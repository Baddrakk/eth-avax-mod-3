THIS FILE IS TO SHOW THE WORK I HAVE DONE ON METACRAFTERS ON ETH
I have created a token contract that requires a token name and symbol to be provided upon deployment. After deployment, I performed operations such as mint, burn, and transfer. The mint function has been modified to restrict token creation to the token owner.
THIS ASSIGNMENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE
PLEASE REVIEW MY PROJECT
THANKS METACRAFTERS !!
